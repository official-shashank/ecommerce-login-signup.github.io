The popular lore tells that good artists borrow, great artists steal.

But it’s actually an ongoing misquoting. Steve Jobs misquoted Picasso, who rephrased Igor Stravinsky, who was probably reiterating on T.S. Eliot’s words, which sounded like this:

“The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn.” 

In other words, it’s okay to get inspired by the work of others and then creatively transform it into something of your own.</p>
